		Hmmer for identifiying UTRs

		Do not take into account the transcripts that do not have downstream regions



SAGE-insilico NOW

Extended regions: t+UTR
Restriction sites (30bps or less)
Reads (30bps)

0. Count the number of reads per transcript  (Reads are unique)
	timescolapse

1. Create transcript + UTR (sequence 1000 bps)  
	Extract_targetRegions.pl
	"./phytophthora_data/phytophthora_infestans_t30-4_1_supercontigsSAGE_Targets_1000.fasta"
		
2. Identify all restrictions sites  (30 bps sequences)
	SAGE_insilico.pl

3. Map all restriction sites to reads
	Reads are BLAST database

4. Save results in SQL database
	blastResults2table.pl
	(restrictionS, read, (identity) % of matching, alignment_len, mismatches, gaps, ...)

4.1. Filter per restriction sites with less than 30 bps

4.2. Filter per rightest restriction site

5. Select results with alignment_len equal to restrictionS_len and identity of 100%

6. Count the right matches between targets and reads

7. Select pairs with one to one relation (bidirectional): unitags



Possible problems
Transcripts without 1000bps of UTR (or no downstream regions)
Rightest restriction site in the 1000bps is not inside the UTR
A significative quantity of genes are been discarded
